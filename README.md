# Stock-Analysis.
This Repository contains an Analysis on The Stock Data.


Overview Of Project:


The Purpose for this Analysis is to Investigate The Performance of Stocks based on Stock Market Data from 2017 and 2018.



Results:


I followed The Instructions for Deliverable 1 Indicated on Boot Camp Spot for this Analysis. I created a Variable called tickerIndex and set it equal to Zero before making it iterate over all the rows. I created Three Output Arrays: tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices. I made sure that these three Arrays got set to The Proper Data Type. I created a for loop to initialize tickerVolumes to Zero. I created a for loop to loop over all the rows in the spreadsheet. I wrote a Script to increase tickerVolumes. I created an if-then statement to check if the current row is the last row with the selected tickerIndex. I wrote a Script to increase the tickerIndex (if the ticker of a following row doesn't match the ticker of a previous row). I implemented a for loop to loop through The Arrays tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices (in order to output the “Ticker,” “Total Daily Volume,” and “Return” columns in my Spreadsheet). I noticed that most Stocks in 2017 generated Positive Return Percentages and that most Stocks in 2018 generated Negative Return Percentages. This Indicates that Stocks in general for the most part Performed much better in 2017 than they did in 2018. I noticed that The Execution Time for The Refactored VBA Script was less than The Execution Time for The Original VBA Script.

Summary: 


An Advantage of Refactoring Code is that it makes Code more Organized and easier to follow. A Disadvantage of Refactoring Code is that it can be more Prone to Errors. These Attributes were directly Observed in The Original VBA Script and The Refactored VBA Script. I noticed that The Refactored VBA Script was definitely more easier to follow and more Organized than The Original VBA Script. I also noticed that The Refactored VBA Script was generating more Errors than The Original VBA Script when I was Compiling it (before they got Corrected).
